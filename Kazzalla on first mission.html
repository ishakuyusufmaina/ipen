    <h2>Kazalla Induction To Kill</h2>
    <p>
      It was early in the morning when Kazalla and his friend, Kaana were on mission to put a thick line between soul and body of a policeman. Kaana, the head of the mission, removed a substance out from his pocket and handled it to Kazalla. "It is a divine medicine against being arrested by solders.", Kaana said. And continued, "Immediately we shot him, put it in your mouth without swallowing, then you will be disappeared and unseen to the solders that may come to arrest us", He instructed his novice friend. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      With a good degree of precision of yielding to command whose source was from above, where the two were sent, Kazalla and Kaana were waiting at a target street. A street on which the probability of the police to pass, on his way to place of duty, some few minutes into future, is almost one.
    </p>
    <p>
    They kept an eagle eye, waiting with their gun, AK-47. The gun was with Kaana hidden between his garment and skin in a way almost impossible for naked eye to see or recognise that there was a gun with them. 
    </p>
    <p>
      At a time, dancing to the tune of their expectation, the police officer appeared. "Observe how the thing is being done", Kaana said to Kazalla. He removed the gun, cocked, headshot the target and put the gun back to where it was, all in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
Kaana demonstrated dexterity by accomplishing the mission with high success rate and hence a good quantum of practical working experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
Immediately thereafter, Kaana, the shooter, was nowhere to be seen even by Kazalla. All people around ran away from the perceived reverberation given birth by the gun sound.

    <h2>Kazalla In Trouble</h2>
    <p>
Nobody! Not even the birds in the air or the insects in the sand. Only Kazalla and the product of their hand work left at the place.
    </p>
    <p>
With a zero distance between brain tissue and ground, the police was drowning in a red river of his blood, a condition ideal to bring tears into eyes, fears into heart and numbness into skin of every human hearted observer. 
    </p>
    <p>
Far away from voluntary control with no friend to help, Kazalla had lost all his mind and body to autonomic neural control that couldn't even prepare him for the "fight-or-flight" reaction. It was his first time to witness not only death of such nature but a natural one. In addition, it was his first time to see the practical implementation of his kind of religion ideology he harboured. 
    </p>
    <p>
Kazalla seemed to be in deep trouble that might make him <strong>rule the day he was born</strong>. He was too disturbed, confused and lost to the extent that he couldn't remember the instruction of how to escape the arriving solders. 
     Vibration, typical of a chronic parkinsonism, was all his body was doing. 
    </p>
    <p>
Fortunate to Kazalla, the solders, as they used to do in cases like these, took long to arrive at the place of the terrible incidence. Before that, he regained some voluntary control and left the place but still not out of sight from the point of the incidence.
    </p>
    <p>
Would Kazalla escape or get arrested by the solders? â€” A question with a boolean answer not yet revealed.
